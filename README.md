TODO:
- [x] share button (share config, share roll)
- [ ] popup when you click the share button
- [ ] mobile sizing - get rid of dock completley and only show the tile that is currently placeable (replace instead of place, should work for all tiles, even blank ones)
- [ ] social media share card with logo
- [ ] fix all the hashtags and exclamation points in path
- [ ] hover effect on tiles (animation that rotates them a little and makes them bigger)
- [x] no cursor on empty squares, hover instead
- [x] detect islands and don't reward points: only reward points for the largest island, subtract points for the others
- [x] zero points if less than zero
- [x] have them randomly on the page, move dock to the bottom
- [x] make tiles rotated slightly
