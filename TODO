Priority:
- [ ] make copy link for sharing work (make it a popup instead?, no alert)
  - copy URL doesn't change the page URL, just gets the base URL and appends
- [ ] icons for buttons

Style Quick
- No highlight text 
- center playing board vertically

Secondary:
- [ ] change the name of this game
- [ ] social media share card with logo (make your own logo, not the actual cross word cubes)
- [ ] animations for when we hover the New Roll button

Long Term:
- [ ] validate words against dictionary
- [ ] animate die roll
- [ ] change url to not be on params, just from the page (hard in Gatsby, would revert to React?)
